Preformance testing app for comparison of connections and transfer rates between middleware and vendor API-s.

Ver 0.1
This app should:
	- transfer data(eg. images) of different sizes from phone to cloud, from cloud to phone
	- should test connection delays, transfer speed
	- different transfer options - files in total amount of 2 MB. For example
		- 10 200kB files
		- 1 2MB file
		- 100 20 kB files
	- use use different connection methods (3G, EDGE, WiFi). Testing from simulator seems to only have importance during the development of the test suite. Afterwards only results from device matter.

Test descriptions:
	- tests should be easily described using common format like JSON or XML
	- test output should be in CSV or JSON for additional parsing
	- tests should be automatically generated from input file
	
Test data:
	- 2 image files for each size should be available

Ver 0.1 of this app will only test connections between Amazon S3 - Phone and Middleware - Phone
